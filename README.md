# Project description

We work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.

Our task is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
